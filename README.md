Nudestrap, a bare scaffold Wordpress theme created by [Craig Gwamba](http://teknicom.net/ "WordPress Themes") at [Teknicom Web](http://teknicom.net/ "Teknicom Web").
The theme was built using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html "WordPress Themes").
It is designed for web designers and developers to use as a quick launchpad to develop their own personal and commercial projects.
It is licensed under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html "WordPress Themes")

Thanks to the following people/sites for code and inspiration:
 
* [Blank Theme](http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/) // Blank Wordpress Theme by Chris Coyler
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) // HTML, CSS and Javascript web framework from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
* [Memu menu](http://www.codebrewery.ch/?p=48) // Navigation menu code from Codebrewery


## Intended use
This is the scaffold I use to build client projects (minus the navigation).  I have provided this theme for use as a basic starting point for anyone who wants to create a WordPress theme.  This is for personal, commercial projects and premium Wordpress Themes.
I ask that if you use this theme to create a premium theme, you give credit to this theme.  If you have any questions or requests for updates then head over to [My Website](http://teknicom.net/) and get in touch with me.

## Installation & Basic Setup
To install this theme, download and **extract first**. Rename the parent folder of the theme to 'nudestrap'. Upload the folder and contents of the 'nudestrap' folder to your wp-content/themes/ directory, then activate from Appearance &rarr; Themes.

## Future Features
This theme will be updated regularly.  These are some of the features you can expect:

* Definitely adding responsive feature. Once I integrate wp_nav_menu with the Twitter dropdowns, I'll update this.
* Theme Options for basic functions i.e: logo, footer options, slider configuration
* Shortcodes.  Basic shortcodes to increase ease of use, i.e: columns, buttons, tabs etc

## Get involved

I would love to see what you have made using this so feel free to get in touch with me.

This is my first freebie and my first implementation of Git so please give me your feedback on both the theme itself and how it has been delivered through Git.
Header over to the [Blog Article](http://teknicom.net/2012/07/13/nudestrap-wordpress-twitter-bootstrap-skeleton-theme/) and drop me a line.  I'd love to hear from you.

Enjoy...
